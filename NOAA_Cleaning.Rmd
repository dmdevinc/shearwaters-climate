# Introduction

Open source sea surface temperature data (sst) in Celsius for Monterey and 
Sonoma counties.

Data sourced from NOAA [dataset name], accessed on [date]. 
NOAA data are in the public domain.

SST has ties to marine heatwaves, upwelling strength, and forage fish 
distribution, all of which could affect arrival for shearwaters.
