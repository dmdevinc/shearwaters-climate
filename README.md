# Shearwater eBird sightings and climate variables off the coast of California - Work in Progress

Is there a climate diven shift in seasonal timing of seabird appearances for Sooty and Pink-footed Shearwaters, using eBird sighting data and NOAA weather data off the coast of California.

## Data
 - ebird: sightings in Bodega and Monterey Bays
 - NOAA: temp, wind, sst, upwelling index, enso index

## Methods 

Group by month and year and identify shifts in peak timing, duration of prescence, and overall counts in the last 10 years (since 2015). 

Stats - time series modelling, visualization, statistical modeling
R packages - ggplot2, seaborn?, Rshiny, Leaflet? (heat map)

## Final Product
Rshiny app and webpage
